Our app is designed to help new graduates find their ideal US county to live in. We have implemented a dashboard that users are abe to select US counties of their liking and then compare certain characteristics about those selected cities in order to find the best fit for themselves.

So far we have implemented a few factors that users can compare cities upon. These can be loosely divided into social category and climate category. Social category includes: Percent Unemployed, Population Density, Percent Population under 18 and Younger, Percent Population 65 and older. Climate Category includes: Mean/Min/Max Monthly Temperatures, Mean Monthly Precipitation Overall, Mean Snowfall and Mean Rainfall. With these categories, everything seems to be working well in the dashboard and the app in running smoothly.

Obviously these categories are not enough for individuals to base their living location on. We need to include more categories. We have many categories in our data but we are just trying to figure out what are the best categories to include in our app. This is a very hard decision because if we include too many our app can become cluttered and overwhelming. However, if we add too little information, users won't have enough information to make the right decision. This is a future improvement we must work upon. We need to find the perfect balance and figure out what factors are most important to people when looking for a place to live.

When thinking about what our dashboard does well the interactivity comes to mind first. Our app is super easy to use and super straight forward. Step 1 : pick the cities you are interested in. Step 2 : Look at the generated graphs to compare them. I feel as though The fact that our app is so simple yet so powerful is what makes it so great. As we have data for so many US counties we have the power to compare thousands of combinations of cities.

When thinking about limitations what comes to mind is if users don't have knowledge on US cities they might miss out on certain counties that could be a perfect fit for them. What would fix this and what could be a future improvement for our a would be some sort of second page where users could instead specify what categories they care about and the graphs could sort counties according to those preferences, and then display counties that fit the users wants.
