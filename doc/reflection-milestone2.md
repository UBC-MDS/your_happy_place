Our app is designed to help new graduates find their ideal US city to live in. We have implemented a dashboard that users are abe to select US cities of their liking and then compare certain characteristics about those selected cities in order to find the best fit for themselves.

So far we have implemented 3 categories that users can compare cities upon. These being: Percent Unemployed, Mean Monthly Temperature, and Mean Monthly Precipitation. With these 3 categories everything seems to be working well in the dashboard and the app in running smoothly.

Obviously these 3 categories are not enough for individuals to base their living location on. We need to include more categories. We have many categories in our data but we are just trying to figure out what are the best categories to include in our app. This is a very hard decision because if we include too many our app can become cluttered and overwhelming. and if we add too little users wont be satisfied. This is a future improvement we must work upon. We need to find the perfect balance and figure out what categories about cities are most important to people when looking for a place to live.

When thinking about what our dashboard does well the interactivity comes to mind first. Our app is super easy to use and super straight forward. Step 1 : pick the cities you are interested in. Step 2 : Look at the generated graphs to compare them. I feel as though The fact that our app is so simple yet so powerful is what makes it so great. As we have data for so many US cities we have the power to compare thousands of combinations of cities.

When thinking about limitations what comes to mind is if users don't have knowledge on US cities they might miss out on certain cities that could be a perfect fit for them. What would fix this and what could be a future improvement for our a would be some sort of second page where users could instead specify what categories they care about and the graphs could then display cities that fit the users wants.
